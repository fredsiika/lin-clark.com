<p>UPDATE: This describes SPARQL Views in Drupal 6. The module has changed significantly in Drupal 7.</p><p>As some of you know, I have been working on a Google Summer of Code project this summer. My aim is to make it easy for site administrators to pull data from RDF datasets into their sites and have that data actually contribute to the site, instead of just being a novelty.</p>
READMORE<p>As part of this, I've been working on a module called SPARQL Views. It is still quite limited, but I wanted to get it out there for feedback. It's also still a bit of a bear to install, but if you can get through the installation process I'd love to hear your feedback&mdash;and if you can't, I'll have a much more user-friendly version coming out later.</p><object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/8F-gT02ZyDs&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/8F-gT02ZyDs&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object><p>Other features of this release are:</p><ul><li><strong>Token API integration for subjects and objects</strong><br /><a href="http://drupal.org/project/token">Token API</a>, created by <a href="http://jeff.viapositiva.net/">Jeff Eaton</a>, provides a very simple way to declare and define tokens in a module. Users can then enter these tokens in the UI as placeholders. The tokens will get computed on page load, so any variables available during the page load process can be used to produce the replacement value.<br /><br />A&nbsp;SPARQL Views&nbsp;use case for this is adding publication lists to user profiles. A field could be added to user profiles so that users could enter their DBLP URIs. Then, with a token defined in a few lines of code, the administrator could create the SPARQL query in SPARQL Views so that the user's publications show up on their user profile.<br type="_moz" />&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Exhibit integration</strong><br /><a href="http://www.simile-widgets.org/exhibit/">Exhibit </a>is a great framework created by <a href="http://davidhuynh.net/">David Huynh</a>&nbsp;that allows site admins to create quick visualizations of structured information. A Drupal module was created to bring Exhibit to Drupal 6 and while it did include a module that would allow people to use SPARQL queries to feed the exhibit, people had trouble getting it to work.<br /><br />I have created a plugin that can be used with SPARQL Views (use the version on&nbsp;<a href="http://github.com/linclark/sparql_views">GitHub</a>&nbsp;to try this out). You have to patch Exhibit to make it work (URL in README) and it is only tested for the basic Exhibit use case with facets. Please feel free to play around and post bugs.</li></ul><p>Thank you to Daniel Wehner (<a href="http://drupal.org/user/99340">dereine</a>) for his suggestion to use a Views query plugin and the initial help figuring out just how query plugins work. And thank you to <a href="http://sw-app.org/mic.xhtml">Michael Hausenblas</a> for providing a use case for me to hack against and motivation.</p>
