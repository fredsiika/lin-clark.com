<p>On June 2, the big three search engines (Google, Yahoo, and Bing) announced Schema.org, which helps them show search results in a more useful way. The <a href="http://blog.schema.org/2011/07/on-june-2-nd-we-announced-collaboration.html">announcement</a> has gotten people really interested in inline structured data such as microdata and RDFa.</p>
