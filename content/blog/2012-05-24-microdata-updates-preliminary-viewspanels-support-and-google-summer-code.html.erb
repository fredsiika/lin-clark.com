Recent developments in microdata publishing support in Views/Panels and Google Summer of Code's support for microdata publishing in contrib field formatters are helping push the Microdata module closer to release.
READMORE<section><h2>Preliminary Views/Panels support</h2><p>As I&#39;ve <a href="http://lin-clark.com/blog/theming-html5-and-rdfa-drupal-7#rdfa-for-fields">written about before</a>, the way that Drupal core&#39;s RDFa works is by relying on the default entity/field template relationships. It places the structured data about the entity in the entity wrapper, placed by the entity template, and the structured data about the field in the field wrapper, which is placed by theme_field. Because of the way the templates are rendered, the field divs are nested inside the entity div, and the RDFa turns out correct. Microdata module piggybacked on the planning that went into RDFa support, so it depended on the same relationship.</p><p>One use case in which this doesn&#39;t work is on pages that use Views/Panels... That is one mighty big use case, and it will be an even bigger use case once Drupal 8 core depends on them. Views and Panels generally don&#39;t use the entity template, but instead allow you to place different entities&#39; fields willy-nilly about your page.</p><p>Fortunately, there is a feature in HTML5&#39;s microdata spec called <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/microdata.html#attr-itemref">itemref</a> which is meant for just these kinds of cases. Using that syntax feature, I have roughed in microdata support for Views/Panels. While I&#39;m sure that there are some bugs to ferret out, I&#39;m very happy that it basically works and am feeling much more confident about pushing towards beta.<p>If you want to test this out, be sure to use the dev version of microdata module and take a look at the <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1588582">Testing microdata</a> documentation. Implementation feedback welcome!</p><footer>Thanks to Kris "<a href="http://drupal.org/user/61203">EclipseGc</a>" Vanderwater, James "<a href="http://drupal.org/user/48673">neclimdul</a>" Gilliland, and Earl "<a href="http://drupal.org/user/26979">merlinofchaos</a>" Miles for taking the time to discuss this at DrupalCon Denver. Thanks to Larry "<a href="http://drupal.org/user/26398">Crell</a>" Garfield for the suggestion to simplify the logic by itemref-ing <strong>everything</strong>, and thanks to Ian "<a href="https://plus.google.com/107429617152575897589/about">Hixie</a>" Hickson for the feedback on how to make that approach spec compliant.</footer> </section> <section><h2>Google Summer of Code project extends microdata support</h2><p>GSOC student Anca Dumitrache and I hit it off quite well when she came as an undergraduate to do an internship at the Digital Enterprise Research Institute, where I was doing my Masters. I frequently thought that she would be a great addition to the Drupal community, and that&#39;s one reason why I&#39;m thrilled to be mentoring her as she extends microdata support throughout contrib field formatters this summer for the Google Summer of Code.</p><p>Anca has a background in data interoperability technologies. Her Bachelor&#39;s thesis focused on working with Drupal core&#39;s RDFa integration in order to create a web resource on cultural heritage. She is currently a Masters student, working as a student assistant in the prominent Knowledge Representation and Reasoning Group at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.</p><p>She&#39;s already well on her way to adding microdata integration and tests for the first field formatter. If you are the maintainer of one of the <a href="http://lin-clark.com/blog/drupal-7-field-modules-popularity">contrib field formatter modules</a>, keep an eye out for her (username collette) in your issue queue.</p></section
